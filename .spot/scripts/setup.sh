# USER CUSTOM SETUP
# ==============================================================================
# Add your application-specific setup commands below.
# This section is where you customize the deployment for your specific needs.
#
# Examples:
# - Clone git repositories
# - Install application dependencies (npm install, pip install, etc.)
# - Configure environment variables
# - Initialize databases
# - Build your application
# - Start application services

# Example: Install Python requirements
# if [ -f /opt/uploaded_files/requirements.txt ]; then
#     echo "Installing Python requirements..."
#     pip3 install -r /opt/uploaded_files/requirements.txt
# fi

# Example: Clone and setup a Node.js application
# cd /opt/deployer/node
# git clone https://github.com/yourorg/yourapp.git
# cd yourapp
# npm install --production
# npm run build

# YOUR CUSTOM SETUP GOES HERE:
