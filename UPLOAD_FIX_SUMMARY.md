# File Upload Permission Fix Summary

## Problem
File uploads were failing with "Permission denied" errors when trying to create directories on newly launched instances. The error occurred because:
1. `post_creation_setup` was running immediately after SSH became available
2. Cloud-init hadn't yet created the `/opt/uploaded_files` directories
3. The upload function tried to create directories without proper sudo permissions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Directory Creation in Cloud-Init
- Moved directory creation to the beginning of cloud-init's runcmd section
- Creates directories immediately after cloud-init starts:
  ```yaml
  # Create directories for uploaded files immediately
  - mkdir -p /opt/uploaded_files/scripts /opt/uploaded_files/config
  - mkdir -p /tmp/uploaded_files/scripts /tmp/uploaded_files/config  
  - chown -R {username}:{username} /opt/uploaded_files
  - chown -R {username}:{username} /tmp/uploaded_files
  - chmod -R 755 /opt/uploaded_files /tmp/uploaded_files
  ```

### 2. Robust Directory Creation in Upload Function
- Updated `upload_files_to_instance` to handle cases where cloud-init hasn't run yet
- Uses more robust command sequence with fallbacks:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /opt/uploaded_files /tmp/uploaded_files 2>/dev/null || mkdir -p /tmp/uploaded_files
  sudo chown -R {username}:{username} /opt/uploaded_files /tmp/uploaded_files 2>/dev/null || true
  mkdir -p /opt/uploaded_files/scripts /opt/uploaded_files/config /tmp/uploaded_files/scripts /tmp/uploaded_files/config
  chmod -R 755 /opt/uploaded_files /tmp/uploaded_files 2>/dev/null || chmod -R 755 /tmp/uploaded_files
  ```

### 3. Added Brief Delay After SSH
- Added a 5-second delay after SSH connection is established
- Gives cloud-init time to start and create directories
- Prevents race condition between SSH availability and cloud-init execution

### 4. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed logging for directory creation failures
- Logs stdout, stderr, and return codes for better debugging
- Success messages when directories are created

## Result
The file upload process is now more resilient and handles the following scenarios:
- Cloud-init has already created directories (uses them)
- Cloud-init hasn't started yet (creates directories with sudo)
- User doesn't have sudo privileges (falls back to /tmp)
- Directories already exist (continues without error)

This ensures reliable file uploads regardless of cloud-init timing, making the deployment truly hands-off as intended.
