# Enhanced Script Upload & File Transfer System

## Overview

The AWS Spot Deployer now supports uploading and executing scripts on running instances using the `upload-script` command, with comprehensive file transfer capabilities. This functionality allows you to deploy and run custom scripts along with supporting files (credentials, configurations, data) from your local directory to already-created spot instances.

## Usage

### Basic Script Upload
```bash
# Upload and execute a script on all running instances
./deploy_spot.py upload-script <script_path>

# Example
./deploy_spot.py upload-script ./test_upload_script.sh
```

### Advanced: Script + Supporting Files
```bash
# 1. Create files directory with supporting files
mkdir ./files
cp database.config ./files/
cp api_credentials.json ./files/
cp deployment_data.csv ./files/

# 2. Upload script - files are automatically uploaded first
./deploy_spot.py upload-script ./deploy_application.sh
```

## How It Works

### Basic Flow
1. **Validation**: Checks if the script file exists locally
2. **Files Detection**: Automatically detects `./files` directory (if present)
3. **Instance Discovery**: Queries the database for running instances with public IPs
4. **SSH Configuration**: Uses SSH keys and username from your config.yaml
5. **Files Upload**: (If `./files` exists) Creates tar archive and uploads to unique temp directory
6. **Script Upload**: Uses SCP to upload the script to /tmp/ on each instance
7. **Execution**: Makes script executable and runs it with `DEPLOY_FILES_DIR` environment variable
8. **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress and results for both files and script

### Files Directory System
- **Automatic Detection**: Tool automatically detects `./files` directory
- **Tar Compression**: Creates compressed archive for efficient transfer
- **Unique Directories**: Each upload gets unique temp directory (`/tmp/deploy_files_<timestamp>_<pid>`)
- **Environment Variable**: Script receives `DEPLOY_FILES_DIR` pointing to uploaded files
- **File Preservation**: Maintains file structure and permissions

## Configuration Requirements

The upload-script command requires proper SSH configuration in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
aws:
  username: ubuntu                           # SSH username (default: ubuntu)
  private_ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519    # Path to your private SSH key
  public_ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # Path to your public SSH key
```

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-file Upload**: Upload entire `./files` directory with supporting files
- **Environment Integration**: Scripts receive `DEPLOY_FILES_DIR` environment variable
- **Automatic Detection**: Seamlessly detects and handles files directory
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars for both files and script operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts (60s for upload, 5 minutes for execution)
- **Security**: Uses SSH key authentication with proper security options
- **Output Display**: Shows truncated output from successful script executions
- **Unique Isolation**: Each upload session gets unique temporary directories

### File Transfer Features
- **Tar Compression**: Efficient transfer using compressed archives
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains file organization and permissions
- **Batch Transfer**: Upload multiple files in single operation
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary archives

## Example Scripts

### Basic Test Script
A test script `test_upload_script.sh` is included that demonstrates:
- System information gathering
- Network connectivity tests
- Docker status check
- Bacalhau status check

### Advanced Example with Files
The `deploy_with_files_example.sh` script demonstrates:
- Accessing uploaded files via `DEPLOY_FILES_DIR`
- Processing configuration files
- Handling credentials securely
- Working with data files
- Complete deployment workflow

### Example Files Structure
```
./files/
├── app.config              # Application configuration
├── credentials.json         # API keys and secrets
└── deployment_data.csv      # Deployment parameters
```

### Script Usage Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Access uploaded files
CONFIG_FILE="$DEPLOY_FILES_DIR/app.config"
CREDENTIALS="$DEPLOY_FILES_DIR/credentials.json"

if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Processing configuration..."
    cp "$CONFIG_FILE" /etc/myapp/config
fi

if [ -f "$CREDENTIALS" ]; then
    echo "Setting up credentials..."
    cp "$CREDENTIALS" /etc/myapp/credentials.json
    chmod 600 /etc/myapp/credentials.json
fi
```

## Error Handling

The command handles various error scenarios:
- Missing script file
- SSH connection failures
- Script execution timeouts
- No running instances found
- Missing SSH keys

## Integration

The upload-script command is fully integrated into:
- Help system (appears in `./deploy_spot.py help`)
- CLI validation (proper argument parsing)
- Smoke test suite (3 additional tests)
- Error handling and logging

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **File Upload**: Uses tar compression for efficient multi-file transfer
- **SSH/SCP Operations**: Python's `subprocess` module with proper timeouts
- **Instance Management**: Leverages existing MachineStateManager for discovery
- **Progress Display**: Integrates with Rich console for formatted output
- **Environment Variables**: Passes `DEPLOY_FILES_DIR` to script execution context

### Code Organization
- `_upload_files_directory()`: Helper function for files directory upload
- `upload_script_to_instances()`: Main orchestration function with enhanced file support
- Progress tracking with separate steps for files and script operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

### Security Considerations
- SSH key authentication with security options
- Unique temporary directories prevent conflicts
- Proper file permissions preservation
- Cleanup of temporary archives
- No sensitive data logged

## Testing & Validation

### Smoke Test Coverage
- **40 total tests** (up from 35) with 100% pass rate
- Command validation and argument parsing
- Function existence and callability checks
- Files directory detection logic
- Integration with existing test framework

### Test Categories
- Basic upload-script command functionality
- Files directory detection and handling
- Help text and documentation accuracy
- Error handling scenarios
- Function availability validation
