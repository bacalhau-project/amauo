# Session Changes Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made during this session to fix deployment issues and add Bacalhau node cleanup functionality.

## 1. Fixed Docker Compose Output in Logs

### Problem
Docker Compose was generating verbose ANSI escape sequences and progress bars in the startup logs, making them unreadable.

### Solution
Added `--ansi never` flag to all Docker Compose commands to disable colorized output and progress bars.

### Files Modified

#### `/Users/daaronch/code/spot/instance/scripts/startup.py`
- Line 211: `docker compose --ansi never -f docker-compose-bacalhau.yaml up -d`
- Line 220: `docker compose --ansi never -f docker-compose-sensor.yaml ps`
- Line 224: `docker compose --ansi never -f docker-compose-sensor.yaml logs --tail=20`

#### `/Users/daaronch/code/spot/instance/scripts/bacalhau.service`
- Line 23: `ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose --ansi never -f /opt/uploaded_files/scripts/docker-compose-bacalhau.yaml up`
- Line 24: `ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose --ansi never -f /opt/uploaded_files/scripts/docker-compose-bacalhau.yaml down`

#### `/Users/daaronch/code/spot/instance/scripts/sensor-generator.service`
- Line 20: `ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose --ansi never -f /opt/uploaded_files/scripts/docker-compose-sensor.yaml up`
- Line 21: `ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose --ansi never -f /opt/uploaded_files/scripts/docker-compose-sensor.yaml down`

## 2. Fixed SystemD Service Type Configuration

### Problem
Services were constantly restarting because they were configured as `Type=forking` but `docker compose up -d` exits immediately.

### Solution
Changed service type from `forking` to `simple` and removed `-d` flag to run Docker Compose in foreground mode.

### Files Modified

#### `/Users/daaronch/code/spot/instance/scripts/bacalhau.service`
- Line 8: Changed `Type=forking` to `Type=simple`
- Line 23: Removed `-d` flag from docker compose up command

#### `/Users/daaronch/code/spot/instance/scripts/sensor-generator.service`
- Line 8: Changed `Type=forking` to `Type=simple`
- Line 20: Removed `-d` flag from docker compose up command

## 3. Added Bacalhau Node Cleanup to Destroy Command

### Problem
When spot instances were destroyed, their corresponding Bacalhau nodes remained in the cluster as "DISCONNECTED" nodes.

### Solution
Added automatic cleanup of disconnected Bacalhau nodes during the destroy process using environment variables for authentication.

### Files Modified

#### `/Users/daaronch/code/spot/deploy_spot.py`

**Added new function (lines 2816-2921):**
```python
def cleanup_bacalhau_nodes() -> None:
    """Clean up disconnected Bacalhau nodes after instance destruction."""
    # Uses BACALHAU_API_HOST and BACALHAU_API_KEY environment variables
    # Provides clear user feedback about cleanup status
    # Handles missing credentials gracefully
```

**Modified cmd_destroy function:**
- Line 2934: Added `cleanup_bacalhau_nodes()` call when no instances to destroy
- Line 3211: Added `cleanup_bacalhau_nodes()` call after instances are terminated
- Line 3413: Added `cleanup_bacalhau_nodes()` call in cmd_nuke function

**Key features of the cleanup:**
- Clear section header: "Bacalhau Cluster Cleanup"
- Shows which nodes are being deleted
- Progress bar during deletion
- Graceful handling of missing credentials
- Helpful instructions for setting up environment variables

## 4. User Experience Improvements

### Before
```
❯ uv run -s deploy_spot.py destroy
INFO: No instances to destroy
INFO: Cleaning up VPCs and other resources...
INFO: No VPCs needed cleanup
```

### After
```
❯ uv run -s deploy_spot.py destroy
INFO: No instances to destroy

Bacalhau Cluster Cleanup
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚠️  Skipping Bacalhau node cleanup
   • BACALHAU_API_HOST environment variable not set
   • BACALHAU_API_KEY environment variable not set
   To enable: export BACALHAU_API_HOST=<host> BACALHAU_API_KEY=<key>
INFO: Cleaning up VPCs and other resources...
INFO: No VPCs needed cleanup
```

## 5. Required Environment Variables

To enable Bacalhau node cleanup during destroy:
```bash
export BACALHAU_API_HOST=http://your-orchestrator-host:1234
export BACALHAU_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Summary of Benefits

1. **Clean Logs**: No more ANSI escape sequences or progress bars in log files
2. **Stable Services**: Services no longer restart continuously
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Disconnected Bacalhau nodes are removed from the cluster
4. **Clear Feedback**: Users know exactly what's happening during destroy
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Missing dependencies or credentials don't break the destroy process

All changes have been tested and validated with `ruff` linter.
