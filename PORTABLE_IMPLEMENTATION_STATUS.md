## üìä Implementation Progress

| Phase | Total Items | Completed | Percentage |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Phase 1 (Foundation) | 4 | 2 | 50% |
| Phase 2 (Cloud-Init) | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 3 (File Transfer) | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 4 (Service Mgmt) | 2 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 5 (Config) | 3 | 1 | 33% |
| Phase 6 (Commands) | 3 | 1.5 | 50% |
| Phase 7 (Legacy) | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| Phase 8 (Testing) | 4 | 3 | 75% |
| **TOTAL** | **25** | **7.5** | **30%** |

## Current State Analysis

### What Works
1. **Basic .spot directory support** - Can read deployment.yaml and config.yaml
2. **Generate command** - Creates proper .spot structure with templates
3. **DeploymentConfig** - Data model for portable deployments exists
4. **Testing** - Good test coverage for what's implemented

### What's Missing (Critical)
1. **No portable cloud-init generation** - Still using legacy cloud-init
2. **No file upload based on deployment.yaml** - Files aren't uploaded per manifest
3. **No service installation** - Services defined in deployment.yaml aren't installed
4. **No convention-based deployment** - Can't use deployment/ directory
5. **No tarball support** - Can't reference external deployment packages
6. **No validate command** - Can't validate before deployment

### Current Deployment Flow
1. If `.spot/` exists, it reads `deployment.yaml`
2. Creates `DeploymentConfig` object
3. BUT then falls back to legacy cloud-init generation
4. Files from `files/` directory are uploaded (not from manifest)
5. Services aren't installed from manifest

## Recommendations for Completion

### Priority 1 (Make Portable Work)
1. Implement `portable_cloud_init.py` to generate cloud-init from DeploymentConfig
2. Implement `file_uploader.py` to upload files based on manifest
3. Add service installation to cloud-init generation
4. Wire these into create command

### Priority 2 (Add Validate Command)
1. Create `validate.py` command
2. Check .spot structure
3. Validate manifest syntax
4. Check referenced files exist
5. Add to main command router

### Priority 3 (Convention Support)
1. Add deployment/ directory detection
2. Auto-generate DeploymentConfig from conventions
3. Support both .spot and deployment/ directories

### Priority 4 (Tarball Support)
1. Implement tarball handler
2. Add to cloud-init generation
3. Support URL and local tarballs

## Files That Need Creation/Modification

### New Files Needed
- `spot_deployer/utils/portable_cloud_init.py`
- `spot_deployer/utils/file_uploader.py`
- `spot_deployer/utils/tarball_handler.py`
- `spot_deployer/commands/validate.py`
- `spot_deployer/core/deployment_discovery.py`

### Files to Modify
- `spot_deployer/commands/create.py` - Use portable cloud-init when .spot exists
- `spot_deployer/main.py` - Add validate command
- `spot_deployer/commands/help.py` - Document validate command

## Conclusion

The portable architecture is **30% implemented**. The foundation exists (data models, basic structure) but the critical execution pieces (cloud-init generation, file uploading, service installation) are missing. The system can read portable configurations but doesn't act on them properly.

To make this functional, the Priority 1 items above must be implemented. This would bring the implementation to ~60% and make the portable deployment actually work end-to-end.
