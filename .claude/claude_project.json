  "description": "AWS spot instance deployment with strict immutable infrastructure principles",
  "rules": [
    "CRITICAL: This project uses immutable infrastructure. NEVER modify running instances.",
    "ALWAYS destroy all instances before testing any changes: uv run -s deploy_spot.py destroy",
    "NEVER use SSH to patch or fix running instances",
    "NEVER create quick fix scripts or patches for existing deployments",
    "ALWAYS fix issues in source code, then destroy and redeploy",
    "For ANY deployment change, follow: destroy → create → test",
    "Treat all instances as disposable - no exceptions",
    "When debugging, only use read-only commands, then destroy and redeploy with fixes",
    "Standard workflow: 1) Make changes, 2) Destroy all, 3) Create fresh, 4) Test",
    "Reference PROJECT_DEPLOYMENT_STANDARDS.md and DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md for details"
