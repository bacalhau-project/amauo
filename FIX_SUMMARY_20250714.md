# Deployment Fix Summary - July 14, 2025

## Issues Found

1. **Syntax error in configure-services.service**: The systemd service file had invalid syntax due to multi-line bash commands with improper quoting
2. **Files not being copied**: Scripts remained in `/tmp/exs/` instead of being copied to `/opt/uploaded_files/scripts/`
3. **Services not installed**: Service files were not being moved to `/etc/systemd/system/`

## Root Cause

The `configure-services.service` file was using a complex multi-line bash command in the `ExecStart` directive, which systemd couldn't parse correctly. The error messages showed:
- "Invalid section header"
- "Unbalanced quoting"

## Solution Applied

1. **Separated the bash script**: Instead of embedding the script in the service file, I:
   - Created a separate script file `/opt/configure-services.sh`
   - Made the service file call this script with `ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /opt/configure-services.sh`

2. **Fixed the script creation**: Used proper heredoc syntax with unique delimiters:
   - Service file uses `SVCEOF` delimiter
   - Script file uses `SCRIPTEOF` delimiter
   - This prevents parsing conflicts

3. **Added directory creation**: Added `mkdir -p /opt/uploaded_files/scripts` to ensure the directory exists before copying

## Testing

After deploying with the fixed script:

1. Run: `./verify_deployment_fix.sh <instance-ip>` to check if the fix worked
2. Or manually check:
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@<instance-ip>
   sudo systemctl status configure-services
   ls -la /opt/uploaded_files/scripts/
   systemctl list-units | grep -E "(bacalhau|sensor)"
   ```

## Expected Results

- `/opt/configure-services.sh` should exist and be executable
- `/etc/systemd/system/configure-services.service` should have valid syntax
- Running `sudo systemctl start configure-services` should:
  - Copy all files from `/tmp/exs/` to `/opt/uploaded_files/scripts/`
  - Install all service files to `/etc/systemd/system/`
  - Enable all services
- Services should start automatically

## Next Steps

1. Deploy a new instance with the fixed code
2. Verify the deployment works correctly
3. If successful, all services should be running without manual intervention
